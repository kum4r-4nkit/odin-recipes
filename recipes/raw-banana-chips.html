  <p>Baked Raw Banana Chips are a delicious and healthy, guilt-free, vegan, and gluten free munching snack made with just 3 main ingredients including salt.</p>

  <h3>
    Ingredients
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>4 Raw and Firm Bananas (400 grams including skin)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoon of Coconut oil (One can use any oil of choice)</li>
    <li>Salt (Go easy on the salt)</li>
    <li>Black Pepper to taste (Optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>
    Instructions
  </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Peel the bananas and immerse them in cold water. I used plain cold tap water.</li>
    <li>Let them sit in water for 10-15 minutes.</li>
    <li>In the meantime preheat the oven to 180 Deg C/400 Deg F.</li>
    <li>Arrange a baking tray with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Now in a large bowl slice the banana finely. I have used a grater.</li>
    <li>Add 2 tbsp coconut oil, salt to taste.</li>
    <li>Add freshly ground black pepper if you prefer.</li>
    <li>Give everything a quick mix.</li>
    <li>Line the chips on the baking tray in a single line not to overcrowd and not overlapping each other.</li>
    <li>Bake in a preheated oven at 180 Deg C/400 Deg F for 30-40 minutes turning in between.</li>
    <li>Turn in between after 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Keep a close eye after 30 minutes as towards the end they get cooked quickly and there are high chances they might get burnt.</li>
    <li>They are done when they are firm to the touch and start turning brown all over.</li>
    <li>Remove it from the oven and let it cool on the baking tray.</li>
    <li>Store this in an airtight container at all times.</li>
  </ol>
